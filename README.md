# Erictope
Erictope is a program to draw models of Euclidean tessellations (and possibly in the future, other polytopes).

I don't know of any polytope rendering software that can do either of the following:
* display nonconvex Euclidean tessellations
* morph between uniform polytopes in the same nonconvex Wythoffian family

Eventually I hope to have fully functional software that can address these problems.

Still in the early stages of development.

# Features
Implemented:
* display wireframes of 2D or 3D periodic tessellations
* rotate these tessellations
* zoom in and out

Planned for the future:
* pan tessellations?
* highlight vertices, edges, faces, and cells
* construct polytopes via kaleidoscopic reflection of points, and with interactive sliders?
* add options to display honeycombs in perspective or stereographic 3d?
* allow spherical polytopes too
* add export feature
* add import from OFF data
